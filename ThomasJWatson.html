        <h1>Thomas J. Watson</h1>
        <p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 - June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who was the chairman and CEO of IBM. He oversaw the company's growth 
            into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR.
            He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines.<br>

            <br>Watson authorized providing Hitler's Third Reich with data processing solutions and involved IBM in 
            cooperation with Nazi Germany throughout the 1930s and until the end of World War II, 
            profiting from both the German and American war efforts. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time when he died in 1956.</p>
